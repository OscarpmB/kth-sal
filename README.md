# KTH-sal
Hopefully this will become a quick and helpful tool that will help you find a free room at kth.

The idea is that the user will input whatever building they are looking for a free room in and the website will spit out if there are any availble rooms. Right now my thought is to do this via web scraping, and then format the result a smart manner and display it to the user :)
